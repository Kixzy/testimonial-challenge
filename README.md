- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt web reponsiveness to an extent but not still perfect at it. Also I learnt the use of grid template column and other things as well.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I think I need to improve on my use of CSS Grid especially the the understanding the grid-template-area
